# dotfiles

I wouldn't treat what I have here as an example of how to do things. Most of
what's in these I've crabbed from others. I'm working on deeper understanding,
but for now I wanted to get a couple of my tools configured to where I enjoy
using them.

I wanted something simple at least for now where I could push to GitHub and
track changes as I make them. Not expecting to make a lot of changes anytime
soon as I want to shift from "tooling" to "coding" for a while.

I'm using GNU Stow to "manage" these, my usage is based on the nice explanation
by Brandon Invergo [Using GNU Stow to manage your dotfiles](https://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html).

FWIW: as written, the fish and nvim "groups" require other tools to work right,
I am currently doing a "intentional configuration" of a laptop where I'm either
(trying to) note everything I've done or (ideally) do it via Ansible. Once I
have the Ansible playbook(s) created, I'll either add them to this repo or
create a repo and put a link here.
